## Data Schemas
*To be defined after Phase 1 Discovery*

## Behavioral Rules
1. **System Pilot Protocol**: Follow B.L.A.S.T. and A.N.T. architecture strictly.
2. **Commands**: Only provide commands for the user to run in PowerShell. Do not run any commands yourself.
3. **Language**: Always respond in Russian.

## Architectural Invariants
1. Layer 1: Architecture (`architecture/`) - SOPs in Markdown.
2. Layer 2: Navigation - LLM reasoning.
3. Layer 3: Tools (`tools/`) - Deterministic scripts.
